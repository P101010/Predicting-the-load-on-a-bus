# Predicting-the-load-on-a-bus
In this machine learning project, we are trying to help MBTA solve these problems by building a model to answer below questions: 
1. What is the predicted load of a bus on a particular date and time? 
2. What is the effective way to utilize bus drivers ? 
3. Which bus route needs additional resources and to balance them?
